# Agent Studio Manifesto

Agent Studio exists because building AI agents is harder than drawing diagrams — and more important than writing prompts.

## We Believe

- Agents are **systems**, not single prompts
- Orchestration matters more than clever prompting
- Guardrails are not optional
- Human-in-the-loop is a feature, not a failure
- Traceability is a requirement, not a nice-to-have

## What Agent Studio Is

- A learning-by-building environment
- A visual representation of agentic thinking
- A safe sandbox to experiment with real patterns
- A reference implementation for responsible agent design

## What Agent Studio Is Not

- A chatbot generator
- A no-code automation toy
- A black-box agent factory
- A system that hides execution or decisions

## Design Principles

1. **Explicit over implicit**  
   Every step in an agent's execution should be visible.

2. **Safe by default**  
   Sandbox first. External actions only when explicitly enabled.

3. **Structure over magic**  
   Goals, policies, planners, tools, and outputs are distinct for a reason.

4. **Humans stay in the loop**  
   Approval gates are part of good system design.

5. **Teach patterns, not shortcuts**  
   Agent Studio favors clarity over cleverness.

## For Contributors

If you contribute to Agent Studio, align with these principles.

PRs that:
- reduce transparency
- bypass guardrails
- hide execution logic
- encourage unsafe defaults

will not be accepted.

Agent Studio is not trying to be everything.  
It is trying to be **correct**.

Build agents responsibly.  
Build agents visibly.  
Build agents that can be trusted.
