# Agent Studio - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
This is a production-quality MVP for teaching agentic AI through visual building.
Built for Vercel Free Tier deployment with no external dependencies.

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Keep components focused and composable
- Add JSDoc comments for complex logic

## Architecture Principles
- No database (localStorage only)
- No API keys stored server-side
- Rate limiting in-memory
- All guardrails enforced
- Execution must complete in <10s

## File Organization
- Pages in /app with App Router
- Reusable components in /components
- Business logic in /lib
- Types in /types
- Static data in /data

## When Adding Features
1. Check Vercel Free Tier compatibility
2. Ensure no long-running processes
3. Add appropriate guardrails
4. Update types if needed
5. Test both sandbox and BYOK modes

## Security Checklist
- Never log API keys
- Validate all user inputs
- Enforce rate limits
- Check execution bounds
- Sanitize outputs

## Testing Priorities
- Agent execution completes
- Traces are accurate
- Export/import works
- localStorage persists correctly
- Rate limiter functions
